\section{\label{sec:FloquetBloch} Floquet formalism}

The Hamiltonian of a generic quantum system periodically driven is of the form:
\begin{equation}
H = \sum_{i,j}^D E_{i,j} \left| i\right\rangle \left\langle j \right| + \sum_{i,j}^D \sum_{n \in Z} V_{i,j}^{\ell,n} e^{i n \omega t} \left| i\right\rangle \left\langle j \right| + \textrm{h.c.}
\label{eq:Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space, ${E_{i,j}}$ defines the static component of the Hamiltonian, $V_{i,j}^{\ell,n}$ is the coupling between the states $i$ and $j$ oscillating at frequency $n \omega$ (i.e. the $n$-th harmonic of the fundamental frequency $\omega$).

To calculate the time-evolution operator we can generalise the Rotating (or Resonant) Wave Approximation (RWA), taking into account the complex time dependence of eq. (\ref{eq:Hamiltonian}). For this, we search for a unitary transformation, $U_F(t)$, to the frame of reference where the Hamiltionian is \textit{time-independent} and diagonal, $\bar{H}$. With such transformation, we can build the time-evolution operator using:
Importantly, in the basis of states defined by this transformation the time evolution operator is diagonal and has the form:
\begin{equation}
\bar{U}(t',t) = \sum_{\bar{i}} e^{-i \bar{E}_{\bar{i}} (t'-t)} \left| \bar{i} \right\rangle \left\langle \bar{i} \right|
\label{eq:dressedtimeevolution}
\end{equation}



The required transformation operator $U_F(t)$ as a Fourier series \cite{ho1983semiclassical}:
\begin{equation}
U_F(t) = \sum_{n\in Z} U_{i,\bar{i}}^{n} e^{-in\omega t} \left| i \right\rangle \left\langle \bar{i} \right|
\label{eq:micromotionexpansion}
\end{equation}

Using this expansion, the transformed Hamiltonian 
\begin{eqnarray}
 U_F^\dagger(t) \left[ H(t) - i \hbar \partial_t \right] U_F(t)  &=& \sum_{\bar{i}} \bar{E}_{\bar{i}} \left| \bar{i} \right\rangle \left\langle \bar{i} \right|
\label{eq:Hdressed}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bar{E}_{\bar{i}}$ with $\bar{i} \in [1,D]$ is the set of eigenstates in the frame of refence where the Hamiltonian is static.

which let us to calculate the time evolution operator in the original basis $\left\{ \left| i\right\rangle\right\}$, just by inverting the transformation $U_F(t)$, according to \cite{PhysRevA.81.063626}:
\begin{equation}
U(t',t) = U_F(t') \bar{U}(t',t) U_F(t)
\label{eq:baretimeevolution}
\end{equation}

\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
\sum_j(E_{i,j} - \hbar n \omega)U^{n}_{j,\bar{i}} + \sum_{j} \sum_{m} \left[ V^{m}_{i,j} U^{n+m}}_{j,\bar{i}} + V^{m*}_{ji} U^{m-n}_{j,\bar{i}}\right] = \bar{E}_{\bar{i}}U^{n}_{i,\bar{i}}
\label{eq:multimodeeigenproblem}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where the couplings $V_{i,j}^{\ell,n}$ define $V_{i,j}^{\vec{n}}$ and the vector $\vec{n} = (0,\ldots , m, \ldots, 0)$ with the value $m$ located at the $\ell-$th position. To obtain a finite matrix representation of this problem we truncate the sum over the number of modes of the Fourier expansion eq. (\ref{eq:micromotionexpansion}). Below, in Appendix A, we show an specific example of the shape of the matrix for a bichromatic driven problem. 

This formulation to calculate the time-evolution operator is equivalent to the multimode Floquet representation of the Hamiltonian that introduces the extended Hilbert space $\left| E_i,\vec{n} \right\rangle$  \cite{shirley1965solution,ho1983semiclassical,verdeny2016quasi}. However, the semiclassical description presented here makes emphasis in the experimentally accessible states, which usually are used to express the static part of the Hamiltonian eq.  (\ref{eq:Hamiltonian}). 

In this paper we consider the Hamiltonian of quaibit system:

\begin{equation}
H = \hbar \omega_0 S_z + \hbar \Omega S_x \cos (\omega t + \phi)
\end{equation}


\begin{widetext}
\[
\mathcal{H} = \begin{pmatrix}
 H_0 + 3 \hbar \omega & V & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &0 \\
  V^{1,1\dagger} & H_0 + 2 \hbar  \omega & V & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 &  V^{1,1\dagger} & H_0 + \hbar \omega & V & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 &  V^{1,1 \dagger} & H_0  & V  & 0 & 0  \\
 0 & 0 & 0 &  V^{1,1 \dagger} & H_0 - \hbar \omega & V &0   \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  V^{1,1 \dagger} & H_0 - 2 \hbar \omega & V \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  &  V^{1,1 \dagger} & H_0 - 3 \hbar \omega 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

In the regime of off-resonant + weak-to-strong driving. More precisely, my numerical results are obtained for the parameters $\omega=1.7 \omega_0$ and a Rabi frequency $\Omega \in \[0,10\]\times \omega_0$. Figure presents the energy gap between the dressed states as a function of the Rabi frequency $\Omega$  and the eigen states of selected parameters.  

The wavefucntion has the symmetry:
\begin{equaiton}

\section{RBM parametrisation of the micromotion operator}

Any wavefumction of the form:
\begin{equation}
\left| \bar{i} \right\rangle = \sum_{j,n} u^{n}_{j,\bar{i}} e^{i n \omega t}\left|j \right\rangle
\end{equation}

The coefficients of the expansion can be parametrised using:
\begin{equation}
u^{n}_{j,\bar{i}} = \sqrt{\frac{P_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})}{Z}} \exp(\phi_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}))
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = \sum_{\{\boldsymbol{h}\}} p_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\boldsymbol{h})
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
p_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\boldsymbol{h}) = \exp (\boldsymbol{b}_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \boldsymbol{c}_{\boldsymbol{h}} \cdot \boldsymbol{h} + \boldsymbol{h}^T \cdot W_{\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{\sigma}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})
\end{equation}
for $\kappa={\lambda}$ and $\mu$.

In case of the Floquet states, the label $\boldsymbol{\sigma}=$. 

The marginal probabilities can be written:
\begin{equation}
P_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = \exp(\boldsymbol{b}_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \prod_{j=1}^{h} \cosh(\boldsymbol{c}_j+ \boldsymbol{W}_j\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma})
