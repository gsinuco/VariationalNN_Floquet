Periodic driving to manipulate the state and properties of a large class of physical systems, solid-state and atomic systems. The descriptoin of periodically driven many-body quantum systems cannot be captured with simple perturbative expansion, and ), and accurate calculation of the time-evolution is required for experimental realisation of dynamical engineering regimes  or robust multquibit gates. Variatoin parametrisation of manybody wave function encode in neural network architectures has been recently introduced succesfuly for compressed representaiont of states with many degrees of freedom. Here we focus on the paramerisation of the Floquet operator of driven two-level systsem using a Restricted Boltzman Machine. We explore the range of strong blue off-resonant driving with strengh varying from weak to strong. The requiured complexity of the RBM with the number of Floquet manifoldand we adapat the to obtain a the Floquet spectrum converges from an approximated solution the Rotating Wave Approximation. The training of the RBM presens all well-known challenges of neural network parametrisation: vanishing gradient.... These results demonstrate explicitly the capabilities and challenges of RBM in describing harmonically driven systems.

\section{\label{sec:FloquetBloch} Floquet formalism}

Periodically driven quantum systems are described by a Hamiltonian of the form:
\begin{equation}
H(t) = \sum_{i,j}^D E_{i,j} \left| i\right\rangle \left\langle j \right| + \sum_{i,j}^D \sum_{n \in Z} V_{i,j}^{n} e^{i n \omega t} \left| i\right\rangle \left\langle j \right| + \textrm{h.c.}
\label{eq:Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space, ${E_{i,j}}$ defines the static component of the Hamiltonian, $V_{i,j}^{\ell,n}$ is the coupling between the states $i$ and $j$ oscillating at frequency $n \omega$ (i.e. the $n$-th harmonic of the fundamental frequency $\omega$). 

Solutions to the corresponding Schr\"odinger can be build after finding a priviliged frame of reference where the transformed Hamiltonian is time-independent and diagonal \cite{}. Thus, we are looking for a time-dependent unitary transformation, $U_F(t)$, that satisfies:
\begin{equation}
 U_F^\dagger(t) H(t)  U_F(t) - i \hbar  U_F^\dagger(t) \partial_t  U_F(t) =  \sum_{\bar{i}} \bar{E}_{\bar{i}} \left| \bar{i} \right\rangle \left\langle \bar{i} \right|
\label{eq:Hdressed}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{E}_{\bar{i}}$ with $\bar{i} \in [1,D]$ is the set of eigenstates in the frame of refence where the Hamiltonian is static. In this frame of reference, the time-evolution operator is diagonal and the inverse of $U_F(t)$ can be applied to obtain the time-evolution operator in the original basis. 

Considering the time-dependence of the coupling terms in the Hamiltonian, we parametrise $U_F(t)$ as a Fouries series of the form \cite{ho1983semiclassical}:
\begin{equation}
U_F(t) = \sum_{n\in Z} u_{i,\bar{i}}^{n} e^{-in\omega t} \left| i \right\rangle \left\langle \bar{i} \right|
\label{eq:micromotionexpansion}
\end{equation}

Using this expansion in the transformation rule Eq. (\ref{eq:Hdressed}) and taking into account the orthonormality of the Fourier basis, we obtain the eigenvalue problem:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{E}_{\bar{i}}U^{n}_{i,\bar{i}}&=&\sum_{i,j=1}^{D} \sum_{n\in Z}(E_{i,j} - \delta_{i,j} n \hbar \omega)U^{n}_{j,\bar{i}} \nonumber \\
&&+ \sum_{j=1}^D \sum_{m\in Z} \left[ V^{m}_{i,j} U^{n+m}_{j,\bar{i}} + V^{m*}_{ji} U^{m-n}_{j,\bar{i}}\right]
\label{eq:floqueteigenproblem}
\end{eqnarray}
which lead us to a finite matrix representation after truncating the sums in eq. (\ref{eq:micromotionexpansion}). 

For concretness, in this paper we consider a harmonically driven qubit with the Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
H = \frac{\hbar \omega_0}{2} \sigma_z + \frac{\hbar \Omega}{2} \sigma_x \cos (\omega t + \phi)
\end{equation}
with the Pauli matrices $\sigma_i$ with $i\in[x,y,z]$ \cite{}.

In this case, the Fourier components of the unitary transformation $U_F(t)$ are the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = \hbar \omega_0 \begin{pmatrix}
 \frac{1}{2} \sigma_z + 3 \bar{\omega} I & e^{i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega}}{4} \sigma_x & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &0 \\
 e^{-i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega} }{4} \sigma_x &  \frac{1}{2} \sigma_z + 2 \bar{\omega}I & e^{i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega}}{4} \sigma_x & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0& e^{-i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega} }{4} \sigma_x &  \frac{1}{2} \sigma_z + \bar{\omega}I & e^{i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega}}{4} \sigma_x & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0& e^{-i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega} }{4} \sigma_x &  \frac{1}{2} \sigma_z& e^{i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega}}{4} \sigma_x & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0& e^{-i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega} }{4} \sigma_x &  \frac{1}{2} \sigma_z -  \bar{\omega}I & e^{i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega}}{4} \sigma_x & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0& e^{-i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega} }{4} \sigma_x &  \frac{1}{2} \sigma_z - 2 \bar{\omega}I & e^{i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega}}{4} \sigma_x   \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0& e^{-i\phi}\frac{\bar{\Omega} }{4} \sigma_x &  \frac{1}{2} \sigma_z - 3 \bar{\omega}I 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2}\\
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0  
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}

The unitary transformation is of the form.


However, due to the symmetry of the, we can select any set of and. It is natrual to select the central columns and repeat, we have to  parametrise only a reduced set of the elemtnes of the matrix.


In the regime of off-resonant + weak-to-strong driving. More precisely, our numerical results are obtained for the parameters $\omega=1.7 \omega_0$ and the Rabi frequency $\Omega \in [ 0,10 ]\times \omega_0$. Figure presents the energy gap between the dressed states as a function of the Rabi frequency $\Omega$  and the eigen states of selected parameters.  

The wavefunction has the symmetry, $n \rightarrow n+m$,  :
\begin{equation}
U_{i,\bar{i}}^n = U_{i,\bar{i}}^{m+n}
\end{equation}
which is used to reduce the number of paramerter below.

The 

\section{Parametrisation of the micromotion operator}

The dressed states defined by $U_F$ are time-dependent superposition of the elements of the basis:
\begin{equation}
\left| \bar{i} \right\rangle = \sum_{j,n} u^{n}_{j,\bar{i}} e^{i n \omega t}\left|j \right\rangle
\end{equation}
with the coefficientes of $U_F$. 

Following the Troyer Calero ... and tohre, we parametrise theses elements with a pair of Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBM) that define their amplitude and phase. Simple generalisation of the RBM for spin systems. In this case, the state of each cell of the visible layer is given by a set of integers that identify the element .  $\sigma = {j,\bar{i},n}$, the projection of angular momentum of the bare and dressed states, and $n\in Z$ the Floquet manifold index. The state of the hidden layer is $\boldsymbol{h} = (h_1,h_2,h_3,\ldots,h_M)$ with the binary variables $h_i \in {-1,1}$ for $i=1,\ldots M$. 

The micromotion fourier components can be parametrized by:
\begin{equation}
u^{n}_{j,\bar{i}} = \sqrt{\frac{P_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})}{Z}} \exp(\phi_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}))
\end{equation}
with the marginal probabilities:
\begin{equation}
P_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = \sum_{\{\boldsymbol{h}\}} p_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\boldsymbol{h})
\end{equation}
obtained from the ... probability.
\begin{equation}
p_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\boldsymbol{h}) = \exp (\boldsymbol{b}_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \boldsymbol{c}_{\boldsymbol{h}} \cdot \boldsymbol{h} + \boldsymbol{h}^T \cdot W_{\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{\sigma}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})
\end{equation}
for $\kappa={\lambda}$ and $\mu$.

In this case, the symbol $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is an array of numbers that 	labels the element of the Floquet matrix. For the driven two level system, we choose $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = i,\bar{i},1/n $, with $i,\bar{i} \in {-1/2,1/2}$ the projection of angular momentum of the bare and dressed states, and $n\in Z$ the Floquet manifold index.

The single layer RBM allows us to obtain an analytical expression for the marginal probabilities:
\begin{equation}
P_{\kappa}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = \exp(\boldsymbol{b}_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \prod_{j=1}^{h} \cosh(\boldsymbol{c}_j+ \boldsymbol{W}_j\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma})
\end{equation}

The cost function can be build from our objective of diagonaliing the matrix. We define the distance of matrix from a diagonal form ...
\begin{equation}
\left\|\mathcal{L}\right\| = \sum_{i} \left| \sum_{j} |\mathcal{H}_{j,i}| - |\mathcal{H}_{i,i}| \right|^{2}
\end{equation}
which is sum of the square of differences between the element of the diagonal and the sum of the norms along each column of the transformed Hamiltonian. 

The parameters are then 


\section{\label{sec:RBMFloquetStates} RBM parametrisation of Floquet states} 

As a first test of the power of representation of the RBM, we evaluate the of the micromotion operator evaluated numerically. This is done by diagonalising the matrix Eq. (\ref{}) and selecting the central group of dressed states.

Since the micromotion opertor can be interpretated as the amplitued of probability in the extended Floquet basis, we adjust the parameters $\boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{h}, \boldsymbol{W} $ using the Kull-lll loss function:
\begin{equation}
k = \sum_i p_i \log \frac{p_i}{p_i}
\end{equation}
with $p_i = |u_{j,i}|^2$

The training starts of wit a random distribution of all parameters with choosen as ..to train both RBm parametrisation of the amplitude and the phase, I loop swapping one after the other, starting of a random initiailization of the RBM parameters. The parameers of the amplitude are choosen as randon, while
